    <p><p>Do you remember how, for a brief moment in human history, you
could fix machines by using violence? No university degrees or user
manuals required, just a good ole slap o’ the hand to the side or top of
the idiot box. And there you go, it works again! This could’ve been
caused by a connection error, some faulty wires that didn’t properly
transmit the video signal. But the point is you didn’t have to know
about that, it used to be a magic solution that sometimes fixed
stuff.</p>
<p>We don’t have wires anymore, for the most part. Most of our
electronics use a PCB with each component attached to it (usually
soldered or screwed). They’re so pervasive and easy to produce you could
even use them for garage projects! It’s as easy as printing an image,
transfering the ink to the board, applying some chemicals and drilling
some holes. And they look <em>waaay better</em> than a mess of cables
connecting everything.</p>

<p>While listening to <a
href="https://cyberpunklibrarian.com/podcast/cyberpunk-librarian-episode-05-charlie-buckets-dad/">episode
5 (“Charlie Bucket’s dad”)</a> from Daniel Messer’s (<a
href="https://twitter.com/bibrarian">@bibrarian</a>) “Cyberpunk
Librarian” podcast, I realized our problems are now mostly digital.
We’ve figured if we remove the wires we won’t have faulty wires anymore.
But that doesn’t mean we fixed the “connection error” problem. In the
digital world we could have an API or program failing because we entered
the wrong parameters. Or, if we have a long chain of different pieces
(which sounds like a generic definition of what a computer or the
Internet is), it could be any of those pieces failing.</p>
<p>What this means is most of the times we can’t apply a magic solution
and hope for the best. Well, turning it off and on again works
sometimes, but it won’t fix all problems. We need to really understand
the problem in order to fix it. This is captured very well on Julia
Evans’ (<a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">@b0rk</a>) <a
href="https://mysteries.wizardzines.com/">debugging adventure games</a>.
In these choose-your-own-adventure games you investigate a problem,
finding clues like if it were a Phoenix Wright game, until you find out
the root cause and fix it. Finding bits of knowledge about a digital
problem, that we solve with digital tools.</p>
<p>And that’s what concerns this post: tools. Even though “tool” calls
up a very physical mental image (like a wrench, hammer or a voltmeter
with a display, switch knob and probes), digital problems in digital
systems require digital tools to solve. And to use those tools we
sometimes need to read documentation, experiment, fix and replace them
when they stop working. Just like physical tools!</p>
<p>Daniel’s point about familiarizing yourself with your tools is as
valid in software development as it is with librarian tools (or physical
tools in a physical job 😛). Yet, perhaps because of the amount of tools
or their “locality” (eg. Apple ecosystem used just for Apple
development), this is a difficult task. Nevertheless, you would be doing
yourself a disservice if you don’t. Learning about your tools is a good
way to find ways to make your job easier. You stop depending on others
to fix things, you grow your knowledge base, you do a more rewarding job
and with your own individual background you could find an obvious
solution that isn’t obvious to anybody else. Like in the example at the
beginning of the post: by understanding the wires were causing the
connection problem, we can ask ourselves: can we fix them? Can we
replace them with something cheaper that doens’t have that issue?</p>
<p>That’s all. This post was mostly an excuse to share work by some
people I like. I hope you found it useful or interesting in some way. Be
sure to check the work done by Daniel Messer (<a
href="https://twitter.com/bibrarian">@bibrarian</a>) Julia Evans (<a
href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">@b0rk</a>), it’s really good! 😄</p></p>
