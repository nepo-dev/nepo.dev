abstract: On how to use a Man-in-the-Middle proxy to reverse engineer an otherwise hidden Android App API, and what to do with that. This is not a post about app development.

---

Have you ever felt frustrated when using a mobile app because of any of the following reasons?

* It lacks simple quality of life features
like filtering, searching, automating actions, etc.
* It is poorly optimized and it is extremely laggy.
Or maybe it takes too long to load.
* It doesn't show a lot of information on screen,
since images and buttons have to be BIG for a mobile app.
Or the complete opposite,
the interactable elements are too small
or don't work well.
The UX is terrible in both cases.
* It takes up too much space on the phone's storage.

If you can relate with any of those reasons, I'm right there with you.
You could ditch that application,
but if you really want to use it,
I've got good news: there is a way around it.
It involves learning about cyber-security,
reverse engineering an API
and automating nearly anything that matters in an app.

Normally we can't see the traffic coming out of an App.
It's **encrypted**, and therefore it looks like random garbage to us.
This keeps your information safe, at least during the transaction
(what each ends does with the information and how they protect it is a different matter).

You might have heard about **digital certificates**.
They are what make this encryption possible,
and in order to know what certificates you can trust or not
your devices depend on a **Certificate Authority** (CA).
These are actors that can create digital certificates

But anyone can _be_ a CA, or they can create one at least,
so how do we know which CAs can we trust or not?
Usually, your devices/applications come with a hardcoded set of CAs they trust by default.
This is a _good enough_ measure that _mostly works_,
although these CAs then become very high value targets for hackers
and you can believe some have been compromised before.

So, back to our little project.
We want to be able to snoop into what our target app and their backend are talking about.
In order to do that, we are going to
force an Android emulator into sending all its network traffic through us
and then make it think it can trust us.
How we will do that is by installing our own certificate as one of those default CAs.
This way, we will be able to understand the encrypted HTTPS messages any app sends and receives.
This is what is known as a **"Man in the Middle attack"** (MITM) in cyber-security.

![Drawing of man in the middle attack]($BASE_URL$/imgs/reverse-engineer-android-app-api/mitm_diagram.jpg)

When we are able to understand what app and backend are saying to each other,
we will begin investigating the now exposed API.
If we're lucky, we might even have the chance to automate our daily app usage into a script.
That way we won't even have to open the app again.

This post will be split in 3 parts:

* [Setting up the emulator](#setting-up-emulator-and-app)
* [Configuring MITM proxy](#setting-up-the-proxy)
* [Investigating the API and automating](#exploitation)

## Setting up emulator and app

### Install the tools

If you don't have the Android platform tools, we will install them now.
I'm using Arch, so I will use these AUR packages:

* [https://aur.archlinux.org/android-sdk.git](https://aur.archlinux.org/android-sdk.git)
* [https://aur.archlinux.org/android-sdk-platform-tools.git](https://aur.archlinux.org/android-sdk-platform-tools.git)

You can install them like:

```sh
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/android-sdk.git
cd android-sdk
makepkg -si
cd ..
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/android-sdk-platform-tools.git
cd android-sdk-platform-tools
makepkg -si
```

It shouldn't be too difficult to find out how to install them on another platform.
For instance, if you're on Ubuntu, you can just do:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install android-sdk
```

On Mac (assuming you have [Brew](https://brew.sh/) installed):

```sh
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew cask install android-sdk
```

### Install the system image

Once we have the tools we need, we can download the system image.
Since we want to download an app from the Play Store,
we will need that the image we use includes the Google API.
We want to find a an image containing "google\_apis", but not "google\_apis\_playstore".
Why not get the one that comes with the Play Store pre-installed, you ask?
Well, those are production builds and we won't be able to root them.
We will need rooting our emulator later.

I chose the "android-25" one, but you can choose another one if you want.

```bash
sdkmanager --list | grep "google_apis" #select another image from this list if you want
sudo sdkmanager --install "system-images;android-25;google_apis;x86_64"
```

### Create the AVD

After accepting the license and waiting for the download to finish, we can finally create our AVD.

```bash
avdmanager create avd --name "mitm-emulator" --package "system-images;android-25;google_apis;x86_64"
```

And open it with:

```bash
emulator -avd mitm-emulator &
```

### Installing Google Play

Download Open GApps for your system image from [https://opengapps.org/](https://opengapps.org/).
We will need them to download the target app from the Play Store.
We can extract it with:

```bash
unzip open_gapps-*.zip 'Core/*'
rm Core/setup*
lzip -d Core/*.lz
for f in $(ls Core/*.tar); do
  tar -x --strip-components 2 -f $f
done
```

Then, we run our emulator and install the packages:

```bash
emulator -avd "mitm-emulator" -writable-system &
```

Wait for the loading to finish.
As soon as the home screen is shown,
copy the Open GApps folders to your system.

```bash
adb root
adb remount
adb push etc /system
adb push framework /system
adb push app /system
adb push priv-app /system
```

We can now restart the emulator.

```bash
adb shell stop
adb shell start
```

After the loading finishes, you will see the Play Store in your home screen.

### Install the target app

This should be the easiest step.
Just log into the Play Store and download the target app.

Make sure you can open it before proceeding.

## Setting up the proxy

### Install MITM proxy

Now we will install and configure our proxy.
We will be using **[mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org)**,
an MIT licensed open source tool built just for MITM attacks.

It can easily be installed from Arch's official repositories with:

```bash
pacman -Sy mitmproxy
```

It seems on Ubuntu you will need to install pip and then install mitmproxy using it.

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install mitmproxy
```

On Mac, just use Brew again:

```bash
brew install mitmproxy
```

To test it out, let's start the emulator
and open its settings by clicking on the 3 dots button.
Then, navigate to the **settings** section,
select the **Proxy tab**
and configure it to use `http://127.0.0.1:8080` as a proxy,
like in the image below.

![a screenshot shows the emulator proxy configured to use http://127.0.0.1:8080]($BASE_URL$/imgs/reverse-engineer-android-app-api/emulator_proxy_config.png)

Run mitmproxy listening in 127.0.0.1:8080 in a terminal, like this:

```bash
mitmproxy --listen-host 127.0.0.1 --listen-port 8080
```

We can now go back to the emulator and navigate anywhere.
You will see it's almost as if your device lost connection,
and if you try to use a web browser,
a warning about your connection not being private will appear.

![a screenshot shows chrome browser warning the user its connection is not private]($BASE_URL$/imgs/reverse-engineer-android-app-api/mitm_no_cert00.png){ .center style="height:400px;" }

This happens because mitmproxy signs HTTPS traffic with its own certificate.
Since the emulator doesn't trust that certificate (yet), it won't even accept that response!
If you go to the terminal where you launched mitmproxy, you should see something like this.
Notice all the traffic is HTTP, there are no HTTPS messages.

![a screenshot shows a get request to http google, redirected to https]($BASE_URL$/imgs/reverse-engineer-android-app-api/mitm_no_cert01.png)

![a screenshot shows more detail on the get request to http google]($BASE_URL$/imgs/reverse-engineer-android-app-api/mitm_no_cert02.png)

To continue, we will need to make the emulator trust mitmproxy's Certificate Authority.

### Install the Certificate Authority

The way mitmproxy works is it has its own Certificate Authority.
It uses it to generate certificates on the fly for whatever
external resource the emulator asks for.
It then uses those certificates to encrypt the messages sent to it,
making it seem like the emulator is talking with the real server.
In reality, though, it is decrypting and encrypting all the messages with its own certificates,
so it knows **everything** the client and server are talking about.
And neither of them knows it is spying on them.

If you read the documentation for mitmproxy you will see there are
official instructions on how to install the certificate on mobile devices:
you visit "`mitm.it`" in the browser, download the certificate and install it.
Then you can see decrypted HTTPS traffic in mitmproxy...
but just the traffic generated by the browser.

If we want to read HTTPS traffic from native apps,
we need to install it as a **system certificate**.
We will need root privileges for that,
so we will launch the emulator specifying:

```bash
emulator -avd mitm-emulator -writable-system &
adb root
adb remount
```

Now we need to find our certificate file.
If you are using Linux, it will be in the `~/.mitmproxy/` folder.
Let's save it to a variable named "CA":

```bash
CA=~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem
```

We just need to copy that file into the emulator's trusted CAs folder,
but it needs to be named with a special value.
The filename must be the hash of the certificate itself.
You can calculate it with the following command:

```bash
HASH=$(openssl x509 -noout -subject_hash_old -in "$CA")
```

But since mitmproxy uses the same default certificate everywhere,
we know the value should be `c8750f0d`, so you can skip this step and just use that value.
You can always come back and use the previous line to recalculate the value if it doesn't work 😛

So you can just do:

```bash
adb push "$CA" /system/etc/security/cacerts/c8750f0d.0
```

If you try to load a website now, it should load correctly and you should see traffic being detected by mitmproxy.
Moreover, if you try to open the target app, you should see its traffic too!
Congratulations!

Don't forget to unroot the device before you continue.

```bash
adb unroot
```

## Exploitation

### Investigating the API

To begin, let's just use the app normally.
Create an account with username and password
(avoid authenticating with Google or Facebook for now,
you don't want to have to deal with OAuth).
Log in, search and browse some items...
We just want to generate some traffic
so that we can inspect it later.

Now we can go back to our terminal
and check the messages mitmproxy caught.
We have to locate the traffic from the target app.
To do so, just browse the captured requests list
and see if any URL matches the app's domain.
Alternatively, you could look for endpoints
that match actions you performed
(like a login, search, etc.).

If you're lucky,
your target API will use a
human-readable document format
like JSON or XML, instead of protobuf.
We are lucky and our target uses JSON.

![a screenshot shows how an intercepted response looks in mitmproxy]($BASE_URL$/imgs/reverse-engineer-android-app-api/response_censored.png)

This means we can easily replicate that request in the terminal.

In the terminal running mitmproxy, enter `w`.
You will enter export mode.
If you then type `export.clip curl @focus`,
your request will be replicated as a curl command
and it will be copied to your clipboard.
You can then paste it on your terminal to see if it works.

For my particular case I had to make 2 changes for it to work:

* Remove the `:authority` pseudo-header that looked like `-H ':authority: domainname.com'`.
* Change the IP address for it's domain name in the URL (`https://1.2.3.4/v1/endpoint` => `https://domainname.com/v1/endpoint`).

### Automating queries

From this point on,
it's just a matter of exploring
and seeing what can you do
with the endpoints you discover.
It's just like learning any regular new API.

For example,
I wanted to automate a search for a restaurant.
It has to be near me (<1km),
it cannot be a bakery and
I just want to know the name, price and pickup time.

```bash
function get_store_list() {
  curl https://x.x.x.x/get_store_list?...
}

result=$(get_store_list\
| jq '.groupings[].items[]' \\ # get all stores
| jq 'select(.distance < 1)' \\ # filter out stores further than 1 km away
| jq 'select(.item.item_category != "BAKED_GOODS")' \\ # filter out unwanted store categories
| jq '(.store.store_name + ", "
+ (.item.price.minor_units/100 | tostring) + "€, "
+ .pickup_interval.start)' \\ # print just the wanted data: store name, price and pickup time
| sort | uniq) # sort and show only unique results

notify-send -t 30000 "$result" # send a notification in Linux desktop
# or
termux-notification --content "$result" # send a notification in Android's Termux
```

This shows a simple list like this one as a notification:

```csv
"Store name 1, 3.99€, 2020-11-04T19:00:00Z"
"Store name 2, 4.99€, 2020-11-04T15:00:00Z"
"Store name 3, 4.99€, 2020-11-04T15:00:00Z"
"Store name 4, 2.99€, 2020-11-04T19:00:00Z"
...
```

It can be then saved as a script and run as a cron job
everyday at certain time (lunchtime?).
This will notify me about available stores to get food from.

Do once. Run forever.
Ok, run until the API changes or something breaks, but still,
it's less worrisome than opening the app and searching manually.
